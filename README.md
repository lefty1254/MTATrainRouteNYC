# MTATrainRouteNYC
A graphical user interface to find the shortest path between two stations in the NYC sunway system.
The program downloads the stations from the mta website and creates a connected graph for them.
After that the program fills in the Interface choiceboxes.
Once the user presses the button, based on his choices the program opens a new window telling him what train stations to go to
and what train to take.
